# Placement Prediction ðŸŽ¯

This project predicts whether a student will be placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ**.

## [View the Code Here](https://github.com/Pakhi-Rajpoot/Placement-Prediction/blob/main/Placement_Prediction_ML.ipynb)

##  Output  
Predicts **Placement Status (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)** based on student data.

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib.pyplot  
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

##  How It Works
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling)  
2. Visualizing data (scatter plot: CGPA vs IQ)  
3. Training a Logistic Regression model  
4. Predicting placement outcomes
