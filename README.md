Predicts **Placement Status (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)** based on student data.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy

- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling)  
2. Visualizing data (scatter plot: CGPA vs IQ)  
3. Training a Logistic Regression model  
4. Predicting placement outcomes
